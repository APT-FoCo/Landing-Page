        <p>At 67, Glenn Diamond has spent a lifetime producing sports for<br>
others, from Major League Baseball to the WNBA.</p>
<p>But this year, he decided it was time to start producing a<br>
stronger version of himself.</p>
<p>Glenn says he had always been active, but a couple of years ago,<br>
“I knew I was not at the peak of my health. I just wasn’t<br>
comfortable with where I was in my health and fitness.” His<br>
doctor urged him to improve key blood markers.</p>
<p>So, he cleaned up his diet with help from a nutritionist — “less<br>
sugar, less volume, more protein” — and lost about 30 pounds.<br>
Then, encouraged by his wife, he joined Alloy Personal Training<br>
in February.</p>
<p>He likes that it’s not a typical, big gym full of 20-something<br>
musclemen and loud music. He says he feels better and has gained<br>
muscle from his three weekly workouts, and he loves his cohort of<br>
group members.</p>
<p>“These are my peeps,” he says. “I feel like this place was built<br>
for me. There’s no excuse for me not to get myself there.”</p>
<p>We bet you’ll feel the same way. Call us today for your free<br>
initial consultation.</p>
<p>Diabetes Awareness: What Are Sugar Spikes?</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard that some foods cause your blood sugar to<br>
“spike.” The glycemic index (GI) helps explain why, ranking foods<br>
on a scale of 0 to 100 for how quickly they raise blood sugar.</p>
<p>* High-GI foods like white bread, sugary snacks, and cereals<br>
cause sharp increases that fade just as fast, so you’re tired or<br>
hungry right after.<br>
* Low-GI foods like whole grains, beans, and non-starchy<br>
vegetables digest more slowly and keep energy steady.</p>
<p>Choose more low-GI foods for better weight management, heart<br>
health, and blood sugar. This makes a big difference in<br>
preventing and treating Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to memorize numbers. Just eat less processed,<br>
and more natural, foods. You’ll notice the difference.</p>
