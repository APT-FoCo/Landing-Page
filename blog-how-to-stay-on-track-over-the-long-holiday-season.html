        <p>Fall Party Fun!</p>
<p>Fall Party — Saturday, November 22 | 11:30 AM – 1:30 PM</p>
<p>Location: Alloy Studio</p>
<p>Food, fun, and fellowship to celebrate the end of the Fall<br>
Challenge — but everyone is invited.</p>
<p>How to Stay on Track over the Long Holiday Season</p>
<p>If the holiday season is a marathon, then it’s best to start<br>
pacing yourself now. Here are a few tips to help you make it<br>
across the finish line in good shape physically and emotionally.</p>
<p>* Be active every day. Maintain your normal workouts as much as<br>
possible. When you can’t hit the gym, go for a walk or a jog or<br>
try bodyweight exercises.</p>
<p>* Work out and eat right in the days leading up to travel or big<br>
meals. That will balance out the inevitable calorie spikes you’re<br>
going to enjoy.</p>
<p>* Eat mindfully. Limit alcohol. Get plenty of water.</p>
<p>* Prioritize sleep. Not getting enough can lead to crankiness and<br>
other body disruptions that can lead to, yep, overeating and<br>
sloth.</p>
<p>* Lighten up and enjoy yourself. Breaks like holidays are meant<br>
to be enjoyed, and you don’t have to let them be too disruptive.</p>
<p>We’re here to talk about any questions you have about exercise,<br>
nutrition and more. Call today for your free initial<br>
consultation.</p>
<p>When retired middle school teacher Leann McWhorter received a<br>
pre-diabetes diagnosis before the holidays in October 2024, she<br>
made a decision that would change her life.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want medication,” she said. “I wanted to take control<br>
through diet and exercise.”</p>
<p>After two decades away from the gym, she found Alloy Personal<br>
Training on social media and walked through the doors in the new<br>
year, ready to begin her next chapter. What drew her in was the<br>
small-group format and personalized coaching.</p>
<p>“I knew it would be tailored to someone of my age and my<br>
abilities,” she shared. “I wanted strength, accountability, and a<br>
community that understood me.”</p>
<p>She had already improved her diet and was walking regularly, but<br>
she’d hit a plateau. Alloy’s strength-training program reignited<br>
her progress, helping her build muscle, lose weight, and<br>
dramatically improve her energy, balance, and confidence.</p>
<p>“I realized my potential,” she said. “I can get up off the floor<br>
without using my hands. I’ve almost fallen three times and caught<br>
myself every time. Four years ago, that would have ended in<br>
broken bones.”</p>
<p>Beyond the physical transformation came a powerful mental one.<br>
“I’m in such a good place now. I look forward to coming in and<br>
getting stronger.”</p>
<p>With her husband facing health challenges, she now feels capable<br>
and resilient. “I know I have the strength and endurance to<br>
handle what life brings,” she said.</p>
<p>Today, she’s thriving stronger, more agile, and surrounded by<br>
friends she’s made in the Alloy community. “Joining Alloy was the<br>
best decision I’ve made for myself.”</p>
